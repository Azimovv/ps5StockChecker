# ps5StockChecker
selenium script to periodically check multiple sites for stock of the PS5


Make sure to add the appropriate chromedriver version to your PATH otherwise this won't work: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Can repurpose this for any stock you want to keep track of.
Just change the url and its corresponding xpath for whatever you want to keep track of,
in this case the 'add to cart' button.
